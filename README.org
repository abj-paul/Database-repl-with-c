* What I have learnt in this project
1) what are ~size_t~ datatype and why do we use it
2) Use of ~enum~ to declare a set of contants to increase readability of the code.
3) How ~getline()~ increases the length of buffer depending on user input.
4) use of ~EXIT_FAILURE~ and ~EXIT_SUCCESS~ macros.
5) How does ~memcpy()~ work.
6) [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20100816/which-is-a-better-choice-to-exit-a-console-freeconsole-void-return-0-or][Difference between ~return~ and ~exit()~ in C and C++]]
* How it works
** Meta Commands
Like in sql, some commands start with a dot(.). They are called meta commands. For example,
1) .exit
** Features
1) It can insert row and print all rows.
* Personal notes for project
1) dont use ~typedef~ when you implement the project yourself.
2) My output should be -> getting bytecode, executing bytecode(CHECKED). Also, test execute_statement default switch case.
